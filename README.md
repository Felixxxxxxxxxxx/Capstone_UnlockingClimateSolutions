## Introduction

After eight intensive weeks of listening, reading and coding at NeueFische Data Science Coding Bootcamp, the theoratical training phase comes to an end. With this capstone project we'll apply our newly acquired knowledge about Python, EDA, Machine Learning on real-world problems. 
As a highly motivated group of four students we decided to not only face one of the worlds biggest challenges with our project, but also an official [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions/).
Our four-week project particularly focuses on the development of meaningful KPIs and the usage of NLP and clustering alogrithms.

## Mission Statement

*"We develop relevant KPIs to help cities and companies optimise and communicate their own climate protection strategy. The aim is to identify and visualise activities and projects that strike the best possible balance between climate protection and aspects of social justice. 
 
We rely on an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis of the CDP-Surveys with more than 1.5 million annual observations. A main focus of our work is the generation of new features and the explanation of the insights gained from them. For the interpretation and classification of unstructured free text responses we use NLP / Sentiment Analysis techniques. We use cluster algorithms to show the connections between social justice and environmental protection, as well as between the interests of the public sector and private companies."*
