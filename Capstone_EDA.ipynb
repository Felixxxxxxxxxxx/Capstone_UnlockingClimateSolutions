    "# 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "Ask relevant questions and define objectives for the problem that needs to be tackled\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 About CDP\n",
    "CDP is a global non-profit that drives companies and governments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, safeguard water resources, and protect forests. Each year, CDP takes the information supplied in its annual reporting process and scores companies and cities based on their journey through disclosure and towards environmental leadership.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDP houses the world’s largest, most comprehensive dataset on environmental action. As the data grows to include thousands more companies and cities each year, there is increasing potential for the data to be utilized in impactful ways. Because of this potential, CDP is excited to launch an analytics challenge for the Kaggle community. Data scientists will scour environmental information provided to CDP by disclosing companies and cities, searching for solutions to our most pressing problems related to climate change, water security, deforestation, and social inequity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Questions\n",
    "- How do you help cities adapt to a rapidly changing climate amidst a global pandemic, but do it in a way that is socially equitable?\n",
    "- What are the projects that can be invested in that will help pull cities out of a recession, mitigate climate issues, but not perpetuate racial/social inequities?\n",
    "- What are the practical and actionable points where city and corporate ambition join, i.e. where do cities have problems that corporations affected by those problems could solve, and vice versa?\n",
    "- How can we measure the intersection between environmental risks and social equity, as a contributor to resiliency?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Problem Statement\n",
    "Develop a methodology for calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) that relate to the environmental and social issues that are discussed in the CDP survey data. Leverage external data sources and thoroughly discuss the intersection between environmental issues and social issues. Mine information to create automated insight generation demonstrating whether city and corporate ambitions take these factors into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Project Goal\n",
    "We develop relevant KPIs to help cities and companies optimise and communicate their own climate protection strategy. The aim is to identify and visualise activities and projects that strike the best possible balance between climate protection and aspects of social justice. We rely on an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis of the CDP-Surveys with more than 1.5 million annual observations. A main focus of our work is the generation of new features and the explanation of the insights gained from them. For the interpretation and classification of unstructured free text responses we use NLP / Sentiment Analysis techniques. We use cluster algorithms to show the connections between social justice and environmental protection, as well as between the interests of the public sector and private companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Evaluations\n",
    "**Accuracy/Completeness**\n",
    "- Did the author develop one or more key performance indicators (KPIs)?\n",
    "- Did the author provide a way of assessing the performance and accuracy of their solution?\n",
    "- Are the KPIs useful for discussing relationships between social issues and environmental issues and demonstrating whether city and corporate ambitions take these factors into account?\n",
    "- Do the KPIs accurately reflect the underlying data?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication**\n",
    "- Does the notebook have a compelling and coherent narrative?\n",
    "- Does the notebook contain data visualizations that help to communicate the author’s main points?\n",
    "- Did the author include a thorough discussion on the intersection between environmental issues and social issues?\n",
    "- Was there discussion of automated insight generation, demonstrating whether city and corporate ambitions take these factors into account?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation**\n",
    "- Is the code documented in a way that makes it easy to understand and reproduce?\n",
    "- Were all external sources of data made public and cited appropriately?"
